1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
So, two words and surviving the first game... Now, the next game is...

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The second round is a speech recognition game.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is a game using your smartphone's speech recognition. If you pronounce a picture word and successfully get the word, you're OK.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The correct smartphone English recognition level is set to "native," so you have to pronounce it like a native speaker.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
By the way, the answer order is this. Two successful attempts and you win.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's hear the first question.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Go ahead.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Here.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This one, right?

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Is it...?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This one, you see...

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It doesn't recognize it unless it's like a native speaker.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Say it like a native speaker.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Then, let's go.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Go ahead.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Girl.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Coat.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What are we going to do?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Go ahead.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Girl.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's Cal again!

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You're going!

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It means it's reaching the ears of a native speaker.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Girl.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You're going.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Native speakers...

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Everyone's like that.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Until now, everyone has managed to introduce God.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
GIRL

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Amazing!

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Amazing!

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Amazing!

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Amazing!

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Wow!

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's a native speaker, you know.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Make a hole at the tip of your tongue.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
GIRL

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Because yours is saying "God," you see.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The second question is this rhythm.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Rhythm.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Rhythm.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Rhythm hat.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Rhythm hat.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Rhythm.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Rhythm.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Rhythm.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Rhythm.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Rhythm.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Rhythm.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You're completely missing the "hat" in "rhythm."

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
A little more...

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's something like a talking hat.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Boak boak.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Rhythm.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Rhythm.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Legoma.

57
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Legoma.

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Legoma.

59
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Legoma.

60
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Rhythm.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Rhythm.

62
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's Cal again!

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Amazing!

64
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Amazing!

65
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Cheap!

66
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Wrong.

67
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Two got it right.

68
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
GIRL is eliminated.

69
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Well then, let's try in three minutes.

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The next question is this.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Rock and roll.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Rocking rocking.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Can you get it?

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Can you get it?

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Rocking rocking.

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The answer is a song Bus likes.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
A song by an overseas artist.

78
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Rocking rocking.

79
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Looking rocking.

80
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Look at me now.

81
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Racking racking

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Racking racking

83
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I don't understand.

84
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Eltoal's, you know.

85
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Racking racking

86
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Jitachaia

87
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Rule stem

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Amazing!

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I said it with conviction, but I completely missed.

90
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Embarrassing guy

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Rule change here.

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Because the correct answer rate is too low,

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The next person to answer correctly will advance.

94
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And the question is this curry.

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Curry

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Curry

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Curry

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Curry

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Curry

100
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Good job everyone.

101
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This appearing means you've come a long way.

102
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Curry

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Good job.

104
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
It's coming out on the K side.

105
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You thought you got it just now, right?

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Close.

107
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Curry

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh!

109
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Oh!

110
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Case

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Check

112
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Oh!

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Amazing!

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
With the leg ramen members all wiped out,

115
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's go straight to the final showdown.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The final is, as expected, these two.

117
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The game we'll be playing here is

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The Complex Guessing Game.

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The Complex Guessing Game.

120
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Oh!

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
This game is

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
a new game where you take turns stating each other's complexes

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
in English,

124
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and whoever guesses their opponent's answer first wins.

125
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If you don't answer quickly,

126
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
you'll end up insulting each other endlessly.

127
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Team group

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We're not winning.

129
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
We're not winning, are we?

130
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Even if you say it,

131
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
it's over.

132
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
When you tell someone about a game you hate,

133
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
you should open up then.

134
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Check's, I'm King Comp.

135
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Impressive.

136
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I let it slip a little.

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Your mutual complexes

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Akabos's complex is exactly

139
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
This one.

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
This is difficult.

141
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Difficult.

142
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Surprisingly, not everyone agrees.

143
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I understand, I understand now.

144
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Not quite.

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
One step

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Meshirata's complex is

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What is it?

148
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I can't see it.

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It's there.

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Really?

151
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Why did you do that kind of thing?

152
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
No, no.

153
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Then let's go one by one in turn.

154
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The challenger is Mesurakamto.

155
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Now, your complex in English, please.

156
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Huh?

157
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Then, Funnies is

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Debut card

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
of

160
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Very good.

161
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Japanese

162
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Heytor

163
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Heytor

164
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Heytor

165
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Heytor

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Heytor

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Heytor

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Heytor

169
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Heytor

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I only have one dimple.

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
That makes it rare.

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
No, I don't have both.

173
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Having only one is a complex for me.

174
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I think that's just how it is.

175
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This guy only has one.

176
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I hate this, do this instead!

177
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
No, no, no!

178
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Well then, a little hint.

179
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
First,

180
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Hirata-san's complex is...

181
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
His appearance.

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
His appearance.

183
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
His appearance.

184
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
His appearance.

185
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
His appearance.

186
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
His appearance.

187
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
His appearance.

188
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
His appearance.

189
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
His appearance.

190
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
His appearance.

191
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
His appearance.

192
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
His appearance.

193
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Because I'm going to Hirata...

194
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Thinking it's one color...

195
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sorry.

196
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yes.

197
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You're all taking out the Himetan Beam.

198
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's close, but...

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Look!

200
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Everyone's operating the Himetan Beam.

201
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It's close.

202
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Teacher!

203
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Teacher!

204
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The hint is this.

205
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Something is...

206
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Too big.

207
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Katakaba.

208
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's probably Katakaba.

209
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Colorful.

210
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
No.

211
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But,

212
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It feels like they think like this.

213
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
By the way,

214
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
His girlfriend's...

215
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
To give a hint,

216
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
As a human being,

217
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That kind of inner...

218
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
A certain spirited aspect comes into play, right?

219
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
OK.

220
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You don't have a lot of friends.

221
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Friends...

222
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You have few friends.

223
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You have few friends.

224
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
That's why I always thought of Hirata-san.

225
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Having few friends...

226
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
This beam means you have few friends.

227
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
That's right.

228
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Gradually...

229
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This game is over.

230
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If we continue any further,

231
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It seems like we'll reach a situation where we can't bear to look at each other, so

232
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We'll end here.

233
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So,

234
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
This time, these two people...

235
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Finally,

236
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Let's all sing the assigned song.

237
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm a flower.

238
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm a flower.

239
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm a flower.

240
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm a flower.

241
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm a flower

242
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm a flower

243
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm a flower

244
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Easy

245
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
What I studied today

246
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Didn't stick at all
