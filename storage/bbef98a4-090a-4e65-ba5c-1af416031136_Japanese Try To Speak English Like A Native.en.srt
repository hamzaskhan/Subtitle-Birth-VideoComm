1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Two words and surviving the first game... now, the next game is...

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The second round is a voice recognition game.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This is a game using your smartphone's voice recognition.  If you pronounce the picture word correctly, you're OK.

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The smartphone's English recognition level is set to "native," so you have to pronounce it like a native speaker.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
By the way, the answer order is this. Two successful attempts and you win.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let's hear the first question.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Please.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Here.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
This one, right?

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Is it...?

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
This one, you see...

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
It doesn't recognize it unless it sounds like a native speaker.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Say it like a native speaker.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Let's go then.

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Please.

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Girl.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Coat.

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What are we going to do?

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Please.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Girl.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's "girl" again!

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You're up.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It means it didn't register to a native speaker's ear.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Girl.

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
You're up.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Native speakers...

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Everyone's the same.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Everyone here has managed to introduce a god.

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
GIRL

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Amazing!

31
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Amazing!

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Amazing!

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Amazing!

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Wow!

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
It's gotta be native-sounding.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Making a hole on the tip of your tongue...

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
GIRL

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Because everyone's saying "god," right?

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The second question is this rhythm.

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Rhythm.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Rhythm.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Rhythm hat.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Rhythm hat.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Rhythm.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Rhythm.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Rhythm.

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Rhythm.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Rhythm.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Rhythm.

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You're not getting the "rhythm hat" at all.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
A little more...

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's a talking hat.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Bawk bawk.

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Rhythm.

55
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Rhythm.

56
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Legoma.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Legoma.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Legoma.

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Rhythm.

60
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It won't work, will it?

61
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Amazing!

62
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Amazing!

63
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Amazing!

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Wrong.

65
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Two failed attempts.

66
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
GIRL is out.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's try with a 3-minute challenge.

68
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The next question is this.

69
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Rock and roll.

70
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Rocking rocking.

71
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Can you get it?

72
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Can you get it?

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Rocking rocking.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The answer is a song a bus loves.

75
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
A song by a foreign artist.

76
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Rocking rocking.

77
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Looking looking.

78
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Looking looking.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Look at me.

80
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Rocking rocking.

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Racking racking

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Racking racking

83
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Racking racking

84
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Racking racking

85
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's Eltoal's turn.

86
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's Kubetz's turn.

87
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Everyone failed.

88
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let's try challenging Imis's condition.

89
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Racking racking

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Jitachaya

91
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The rule's stem

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I said it with great conviction, but...

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You were totally right.

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That's embarrassing.

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Rule change here.

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Because the correct answer rate is too low,

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The next person to answer correctly will win.

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
And the question is this curry.

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Curry

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Curry

101
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Curry

102
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
"Good job" is a good job.

103
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The fact that this comes out means you're doing well.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Curry

105
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Curry

106
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Good job.

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
K's side is going to come out.

108
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You thought you got it just now, right?

109
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
It was close.

110
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Curry

111
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Wow

112
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Wow

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Wow

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Wow

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Wow

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Wow

117
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That's amazing.

118
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
With the leg ramen members all wiped out,

119
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's go straight to

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
the final battle.

121
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes.

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The final match is, of course,

123
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
these two.

124
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The game we'll be playing here is

125
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
the Complex Atty Game.

126
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
This game is

127
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
a new game where you take turns stating each other's complexes in English,

128
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and the first person to guess the other's answer wins.

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If you don't answer quickly,

130
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
you'll end up talking bad about your opponent forever.

131
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Team, Gzerop?

132
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's different because

133
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's unfair.

134
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
That's why you should say it properly.

135
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Even with this,

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Even if you say it,

137
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes, it's called Oshimaimai.

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Toys...

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Toys...

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
When you say "a game someone hates,"

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
you should open it then.

142
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Of course, I'm King Comp.

143
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Toys...

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I said it.

145
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What are your mutual complexes?

146
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Akamon's complex is

147
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Exactly

148
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Difficult

149
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Difficult

150
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Everyone agrees, right?

151
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Everyone agrees now, right?

152
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I see, I see.

153
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
On the other hand, Meshiratar's complex is?

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What is it?

155
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Invisible.

156
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It exists.

157
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Really?

158
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Were you laughing when you saw Noujon and thought you'd go for it?

159
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
No, no.

160
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Let's go one by one in turn.

161
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The first one is Mesurakamon

162
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Part-time job

163
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Please say "complex" in English.

164
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Huh?

165
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Japanese

166
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Diaphanies

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Diaphanies

168
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Diaphanies

169
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Diaphanies

170
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Diaphanies

171
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Diaphanies

172
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What will open next time?

173
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What will open next?

174
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I only have one dimple.

175
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
And I'm self-conscious about it.

176
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No, it's because I don't have both.

177
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Only having one is my complex.

178
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
That's the thing about it.

179
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
This one, I only have one.

180
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I hate this, I hate this.

181
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
No, no, no.

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Then, a little hint.

183
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
First,

184
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Hirata-san's complex is

185
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Appearance.

186
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Namagos-san's complex is

187
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
More like, feelings about games.

188
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes, that's right.

189
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Huh

190
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Galley can

191
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
The cat is

192
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Hiroi

193
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The cat is Hiroi

194
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This is also Hiroi

195
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
No, this

196
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Slight

197
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I thought I was one color from Hiroi.

198
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm sorry, not that much.

199
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Never mind the excuses.

200
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's totally in a month.

201
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Everyone sees the Himetan beam.

202
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
It's close, but

203
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Everyone is

204
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Drawn to the Himetan beam.

205
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Sensei

206
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Sensei

207
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The hint is this.

208
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Let's go to the hint.

209
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Something is

210
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Too big.

211
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Two bake

212
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Katakaba

213
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Katakaba

214
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Katakaba

215
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Katakaba

216
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
But, it feels like they think this way.

217
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
By the way, Karojo's

218
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
To give a hint,

219
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
As a human being,

220
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
That kind of inner

221
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
One spirited minute comes, right?

222
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Ah, OK.

223
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You don't have a lot of friends.

224
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Gutsdar

225
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Ah, friends

226
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't have many friends.

227
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I don't have many friends.

228
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So, the hint every time is

229
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I don't have many friends.

230
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't have many friends.

231
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I don't have many friends.

232
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
First, this

233
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
With this beam,

234
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I don't have many friends.

235
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Gradually,

236
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
With this beam,

237
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I don't have many friends.

238
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
If we continue any further,

239
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
We'll reach a point where we can't look at each other, so

240
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
We'll end here.

241
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So this time

242
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
These two people

243
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Survivor

244
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Finally, to conclude

245
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Let's all sing the challenge song

246
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm a star

247
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm a star

248
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm a star

249
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I'm a star

250
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm a star

251
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I'm a star

252
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm a star

253
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm a star

254
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I'm a star

255
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm a star

256
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm a star

257
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm a star

258
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm a star

259
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Yeah!

260
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's a star

261
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What we studied today

262
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Didn't amount to anything
